## Minecraft TrueType/OpenType Font Support Mod ##

The BetterFonts mod adds TrueType/OpenType font support for Minecraft. This mod will use the fonts installed on your system for drawing text instead of the builtin bitmap fonts that come with Minecraft. Languages such as Arabic and Hindi look much better with this mod since both require complex layout that the bitmap fonts simply can't provide. All in-game text will change to use the new fonts including GUIs, the F3 debug screen, chat, and even signs. This mod should have little or no impact on performance.

### Requirements: ###
[Minecraft Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/), 
[CodeChickenCore](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/909223-/).

### Installation: ###
Just put .jar into your mods directory.

### Compiling: ###
Download and extract minecraftforge-src to the basedir first.
Do:
```shell
cd forge
./install.sh|bat
cd mcp
./updatemd5.sh|bat
```
Put both CodeChickenCore and CodeChickenLib into forge/mcp/lib.
Then run ant.

### Configuration: ###
You can have a config file to change the default font and text size this mod uses. If your game is installed in a `.minecraft` directory, then the config file will be `.minecraft/config/BetterFonts.cfg` (the same place ModLoader keeps its config files). Please note that the `config` directory does **not go inside minecraft.jar** but directly into the game folder. You can either [download](http://dev.bukkit.org/media/files/587/923/BetterFonts_Config.zip) the config file or look at the example below:
```ini
# This is the BetterFonts configuration file. Any lines that start with # are
# comments and get ignored. If the same property name appears multiple times
# in the file, only the last value will be used.

# The font.name property changes the default font used in Minecraft. This can
# be the name of a real font like Times New Roman, or one of Java's logical
# fonts like Serif, SansSerif, or Monospaced. If font.name is missing, the
# default font used will be SansSerif.
font.name=SansSerif
#font.name=Monospaced
#font.name=Times New Roman

# You can use the font.size property to affect how large or small the text
# will appear. This must be an integer greater than zero, and if omitted
# the default size used is 18.
font.size=18

# This property enables anti-aliasing which blurs the edges of the font to
# make it seem less jagged, but this can also make the font seem less sharp.
# The property should be set to either the word "true" or "false, and you'll
# have to experiment with both options to determine which one looks better.
# If font.antialias is missing, the default is to disable anti-aliasing.
font.antialias=false
#font.antialias=true

# By default, Minecraft draws drop shadow for any text in the GUIs and the
# chat. Setting this to "false" will disable this shadow which can make some
# fonts more readable.
font.dropshadow=true
#font.dropshadow=false
```
